# ECE WebTech Chat

This is a chat application we wrote to learn the basics and the not so basics features of backend and frontend web programing. It leverages Node.js and React as well as complementary technologies such as unit testing with Mocha and Should.js, embeded storage with LevelDB, REST APIs, ...

## Usage

Start the web application:

```bash
npm run develop
Chat is waiting for you at http://localhost:3000
```

Run the tests with mocha:

```bash
npm run test
```

Start the back:

```bash
npm start
```
